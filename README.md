Uh, hi...<br>
Why are you here?<br>
This is full of garbage... just kidding... I guess...<br>
<br>
Anyway,<br>
I know a little about C# from school and a lot from random StackOverflow questions, and, uh, ... (almost) every program is safe to use, I think...<br>
<br>
**DISCLAIMER**<br>
I am not responsible for any diseases like heart attacks, loss of IQ and murder of brain cells due to prolonged look at the source code or scrolling through my GitHub.<br>
Every project in here should not be taken, uh, seriously?, I'm just trying to learn some stuff and mess with more stuff! 😛<br>
