Uh, hi...<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
This is full of garbage... just kidding! I guess...<br/>
<!-- P2 -->
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
I know a little about C# from school and a lot from random StackOverflow questions, and, uh, ... (almost) every program is safe to use, I think... (<b>WELL EXCEPT</b> <a href="https://github.com/Milkenm/VBucksGenerator">VBucksGenerator</a>, <b>DON'T RUN IT</b>, it's nothing harmful tho, just a prank bro)<br/>
I also know some Java (I mean, it's almost C#) and I'm using it, together with my amazing programming skilz, to make a Minecraft server. Not an #ad, but if you wanna join: mc.milkenm.net on 1.19 is the way to go. You can also try my hunger games server at hg.milkenm.net (1.19.3) ;)<br/>

<br/>
Oh don't forget to join my amazing Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/xRyvAps">🎀𝓒𝓱𝓲𝓵𝓵𝓲𝓷'𝓡𝓸𝓸𝓶🎀</a> where nothing happens but has an announcement channel with free games if you want...<br/>

<b>DISCLAIMER</b><br/>
I am not responsible for any diseases like heart attacks, loss of IQ and murder of brain cells due to prolonged look at the source code or scrolling through my GitHub.<br/>
Every project in here should not be taken, uh, seriously?, I'm just trying to learn some stuff and mess with more stuff! 😛<br/>
