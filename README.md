Anyway,<br/>
I know a little about C# from school and a lot from random StackOverflow questions, and, uh, ... (almost) every program is safe to use, I think... (**WELL EXCEPT** [VBucksGenerator](https://github.com/Milkenm/VBucksGenerator), **DON'T RUN IT**, it's nothing harmful tho, just a prank bro)<br/>

I am not responsible for any diseases like heart attacks, loss of IQ and murder of brain cells due to prolonged look at the source code or scrolling through my GitHub.<br/>
Every project in here should not be taken, uh, seriously?, I'm just trying to learn some stuff and mess with more stuff! 😛<br/>
