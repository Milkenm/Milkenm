Uh, hi...
Why are you here?
This is full of garbage... just kidding... I guess...

Anyway,
I know a little about C# from school and a lot from random StackOverflow questions, and, uh, ... (almost) every program is safe to use, I think...

I am not responsible for any diseases like heart attacks, loss of IQ and murder of brain cells due to prolonged look at the source code or scrolling through my GitHub.
Every project in here should not be taken, uh, seriously?, I'm just trying to learn some stuff and mess with more stuff! ðŸ˜›
