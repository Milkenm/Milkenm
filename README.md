Uh, hi...<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
This is full of garbage... just kidding... I guess...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
I know a little about C# from school and a lot from random StackOverflow questions, and, uh, ... (almost) every program is safe to use, I think... (**DON'T RUN [VBucksGenerator](https://github.com/Milkenm/VBucksGenerator)**)<br/>
<br/>
Oh don't forget to join my amazing Discord server [🎀𝓒𝓱𝓲𝓵𝓵𝓲𝓷'𝓡𝓸𝓸𝓶🎀](https://discord.gg/xRyvAps) where nothing happens but has an announcement channel with free games if you want...<br/>
<br/>
**DISCLAIMER**<br/>
I am not responsible for any diseases like heart attacks, loss of IQ and murder of brain cells due to prolonged look at the source code or scrolling through my GitHub.<br/>
Every project in here should not be taken, uh, seriously?, I'm just trying to learn some stuff and mess with more stuff! 😛<br/>
