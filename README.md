I know some C#/Java/JS... and thats it. Don't really know to use those things everyone uses such as Docket, Node, mainly because I never needed it anyway.
<br/>
Looking at my repos, almost every program is safe to use, I think... (<b>WELL EXCEPT</b> <a href="https://github.com/Milkenm/VBucksGenerator">VBucksGenerator</a>, <b>DON'T RUN IT</b>, it's nothing harmful tho, just changes your wallpaper and shutsdown your PC after like 10 popups).
<br/>
Most of my "programs" (if you can call them that) are not optimized, don't have error handling, nothing. They just run on my PC if I'm lucky enough. The best code is on the repos that have projects, such as [ScriptsLib](https://github.com/Milkenm/ScriptsLib) and [Diamond](https://github.com/Milkenm/Diamond). I have more but they are private :)
<!-- Minecraft --><br/>
I have some Minecraft servers too, made using my amazing Java skills:
* **Pure Server** (mc.milkenm.net / 1.19): A mixed server (more based on survival) with crazy items and enchantments, tweaks to the default vanilla mobs and items and more random stuff;
* **Hunger Games** Legacy (hg.milkenm.net / 1.19.3): A hunger games server based on the 2014 brasilian WinCraft server' hunger games. No arena, just survival and kits.
