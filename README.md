### 👋 Hi there! I'm Milkenm!

#### 💻 What I Use:
I'm familiar with C# and Java. I'm still learning new stuff and improving my ways of coding. Even after 8+ years of doing projects, my code still looks like I've started 2 weeks ago :(

#### 💽 About My Repos:
You can browse my repositories with confidence—most of my software is safe to use. **Caution:** The [VBucksGenerator](https://github.com/Milkenm/VBucksGenerator) is an exception; **do not run it**. It’s harmless fun that changes your wallpaper and triggers a shutdown after several pop-ups.

My coding projects are pretty straightforward:
- They might not be optimized.
- Error handling? Not really there.
- But they work (at least on my machine)!
- The best examples of my work are in projects like [ScriptsLib](https://github.com/Milkenm/ScriptsLib) and [Diamond](https://github.com/Milkenm/Diamond).

> [!WARNING]
> If you are, for some unknown reason, wanting to implement my projects into real applications, please don't. It will crash for sure.
> 
> You can, however, use them to learn **what not to do** when coding.

#### 🎮 Minecraft Servers:
I also run some Minecraft servers, made using my amazing Java skills:
- **Pure Server** (`mc.milkenm.net` / Version **1.19**): A survival-focused server with custom items, enchantments, and more.
- **Hunger Games Legacy** (`hg.milkenm.net` / Version **1.19.3**): Inspired by the 2014 Brazilian WinCraft server's Hunger Games. Pure survival with kits, last alive wins.
